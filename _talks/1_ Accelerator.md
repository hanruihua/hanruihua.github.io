- This research aims to design an accelerator which can detect the charge generated from the piezoelectric material by the vibration of the mass to calculate the corresponding acceleration.
- <i>Responsibilities</i>: Designed and optimized the detailed size of the accelerator model to obtain a higher performance by theoretical analysis and simulation with ANSYS.
- The following figure depicts the static mechanics simulation of the accelerator model when applied a accelerated speed on the mass.
