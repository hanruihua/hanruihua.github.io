- This research aim at developing the self-driving system for the bus with exteroceptive sensors including LIDARs and cameras to perform autonomous navigation on the road. 
- Responsibilities: Developing the algorithm for localization of the bus with binocular camera based on ORB SLAM and filter algorithm such as EKF, PF.

- The following video demonstrates the process of binocular video to localise the bus based on ORB-SLAM.
