- This research aims to design an ultrasound pump model based on piezoelectric material which can generate a traveling wave to drive fluid when AC voltage applied.
- <i>Responsibilities</i>: Designed and optimized the detailed size of the pump model to obtain a higher performance by the fluid analysis using ANSYS simulation. 
- The following figure depicts the distribution of displacement in the pump model when applied the voltage
