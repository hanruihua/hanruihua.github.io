- This research aims to develop the self-driving system for the campus bus with exteroceptive sensors including LIDARs and cameras to perform autonomous navigation on the road. [[project page]](http://172.18.8.229/en/)
- <i>Responsibilities</i>: Developing the algorithm for the localization of the bus with binocular camera based on ORB SLAM and filter algorithm such as EKF, PF.

- The following video demonstrates the processing of binocular video that we collected from the bus to localise it based on ORB-SLAM.
