- This research aims to develop a range only collision avoidance approach for multi-robot systems using the low-cost sensors like the UWB modules.
- <i>Responsibilities</i>: Developing the particle filter based approach to estimate the relative coordinates from the range-only measurements. Utilizing these relative coordinates, the NH-ORCA is extended to calculate a safety velocity for each robot.
- The following video demonstrates the simulation and experiment of this project.
