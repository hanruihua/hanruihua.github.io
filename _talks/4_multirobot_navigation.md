- This research aims to find the optimal paths for multiple robots navigating in the 2d environment with time efficient and collision avoidance via deep reinforcement learning
- <i>Responsibilities</i>: Utilizing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to learn the navigation policy for each robot to find the optimal path. Besides, the policy gap between simulation and real world is alleviated by applying the noise during the learning process.
- The following video demonstrates the simulation and experiment of this approach.
