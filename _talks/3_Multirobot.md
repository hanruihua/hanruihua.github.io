- This research aim to localise a group of robots by the relative observation between two robots in featureless environment where has no fixed landmark
- Responsibilities: Developing the decentralized algorithm based on EKF which fuses the odometry and relative observation that derived from the camera to perform the cooperative localization.                 

- The following video demonstrates the experiment in our lab.
