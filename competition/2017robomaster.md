- This research aims to design an accelerator which can detect the charge generated from the piezoelectric material by the vibration of the mass to calculate the corresponding acceleration.
- Responsibilities: Optimizing the detailed size of the model to obtain a better performance by theoretical derivation and simulation with ANSYS

- The following figure depicts the distribution of the charge in the accelerator model when applied a accelerated speed on the mass.
