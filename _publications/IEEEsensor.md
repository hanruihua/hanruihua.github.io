## Abstract
In this paper, we propose an improved UWB based indoor localization system using Bayesian filtering techniques. The system contains two key components: (1) miniaturized, high updating rate and highly reconfigurable UWB sensors with a linear regression model to calibrate range measurement errors; (2) a set of Bayesian filters which can improve the localization precision by utilizing the spatial correlation between the stationary UWB base stations and the mobile UWB station. Furthermore, a novel measurement transform is proposed to reduce the computational complexity. Experiments are performed in an indoor environment with the ground truth obtained by the motion capture system to validate and evaluate the proposed indoor localization system.
