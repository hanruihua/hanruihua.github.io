## Abstract
The localization problem plays a central role in the development of large-scale multiple robots systems. This paper proposes a distributed framework based on the factor graph and sum-product algorithm to localize a large number of ground robots equipped with proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors. The novelty of this paper includes threefold: (1) developing a distributed architecture based on the factor graph to solve the localization problem for large-scale robot systems with few landmarks, (2) developing a multi-modality information fusion algorithm to improve the accuracy and consistency of state estimation through the sum-product algorithm. (3) developing an information selection scheme to reduce the computational cost. We implement the proposed distributed localization method with 100 simulated robot agents and 10 physical robots. Various simulation and experiment results have validated the superior performance in terms of high robustness and low computational complexity of the proposed system.
