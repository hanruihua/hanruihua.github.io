* I am currently working as a research assistant in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.sustc.edu.cn/en/about/index/) at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). 

* I obtained Bachelor's Degree from [Wuhan University of Technology](http://english.whut.edu.cn/) in Industrial Equipment and Control Engineering, and Master's Degree from [Xiamen University](http://en.xmu.edu.cn/) in Microelectronics and Solid State Electronics. 

* I have been looking for opportunities to pursue graduate study. My research interests lie in the general area of <b>robotics</b>. My current research focuses on the localization of multiple robots equipped with cameras or laser radars based on the filter algorithm such as Bayes filter, as well as their applications in the autonomous driving.
