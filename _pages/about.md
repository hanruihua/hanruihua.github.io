* I am currently working as a research assistant in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.sustc.edu.cn/en/about/index/) at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). 

* I obtained Bachelor's Degree in [Wuhan University of Technology](http://english.whut.edu.cn/) in Industrial Equipment and Control Engineering, and Master's Degree from [Xiamen University](http://en.xmu.edu.cn/) in Microelectronics and Solid State Electronics. 

* My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep representation learning and reinforcement learning, as well as their applications in sequential decision making, generative modeling, natural language understanding and multi-agent systems.

* My research interests lie in the general area of Robotics, including the mechanical design, control algorithm and unmanned navigation   particularly in robot localization, as well as their applications in , generative modeling, natural language understanding and multi-agent systems.
