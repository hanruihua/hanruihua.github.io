* I am currently working as a research assistant in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.sustc.edu.cn/en/about/index/) at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). 

* I obtained Bachelor's Degree from [Wuhan University of Technology](http://english.whut.edu.cn/) in Industrial Equipment and Control Engineering, and Master's Degree from [Xiamen University](http://en.xmu.edu.cn/) in Microelectronics and Solid State Electronics. 

* My research interests lie in the general area of Robotics, including the mechanical design, control algorithm, robot localization and mapping. My current research area focuses on localization of robot which equipped with camera or laser radar based on filter algorithm, as well as their applications in self-driving car.
