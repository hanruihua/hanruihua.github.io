* I am currently working as a research assistant in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.sustc.edu.cn/en/about/index/) at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). 

* I obtained Bachelor's Degree from [Wuhan University of Technology](http://english.whut.edu.cn/) in Industrial Equipment and Control Engineering, and Master's Degree from [Xiamen University](http://en.xmu.edu.cn/) in Microelectronics and Solid State Electronics. 

* My research interests lie in the general area of <b>robotics</b>， especially the <b>vison based robot navigation</b>, including the localization, mapping and learning. My current research focuses on the <b>cooperative visual SLAM of multiple robots </b> equipped with cameras and Lidar based on the ORB SLAM, as well as their applications in the autonomous driving.
